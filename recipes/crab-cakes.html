<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A crab cake is a variety of fishcake that is popular in the United States. It is composed of crab meat and various
    other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, mayonnaise, mustard (typically prepared mustard, but sometimes mustard
    powder), eggs, and seasonings. The cake is then sautéed, baked, grilled, deep fried, or broiled.</p>
<p>Crab cakes are traditionally associated with the area surrounding the Chesapeake Bay, in particular the states of
    Maryland and Virginia.</p>
<p>Although the earliest use of the term "crab cake" is commonly believed to date to Crosby Gaige's 1939 publication New
    York World's Fair Cook Book in which they are described as "Baltimore crab cakes," earlier usages can be found such
    as in Thomas J. Murrey's book Cookery with a Chafing Dish published in 1891.</p>
